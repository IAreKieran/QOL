TODOs

python docker tests for init functionality
make uninstaller
automate shell & bash PS1 formatting variables (maybe add extra shell testing before this one)
make nicer method to set shell variables (early in rc) based on (non)interactive (non)login etc (e.g exporting QOL_BASH_DIR, $ENV etc)
Make method to generate QOL.init based on shell choices
Unset all unneeded variables from init.sh and functions

ls ~/test/.bash_functions /.testrc ~/.gitrc ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc_suffix -lah

Make QOL_sed which uses --posix or not
maybe generalise to other programs that common to each user but work differently on different shells


Make something that goes through QOL.init, confirming that all files have been linked correctly after install


Shell status:-
Full tested support on ash, dash, bash, ksh93

Installs on csh, tcsh, zsh - no PS1 support
